= The plugin looks unstyled when I activate it. Why is this? =

"Our Partners by WOWProjects" is a lean plugin that aims to keep it's purpose as clean and clear as possible. Thus, we don't load any preset CSS styling, to allow full control over the styling within your theme or child theme.
You can add a basic styling by coping and pasting the following code into your style.css on your theme. [css code](https://gist.github.com/xicoofficial/51fb6f8db3cf4e6ff461).
